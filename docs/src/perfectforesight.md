## General structure of the notes

First draft of notes on the code for the perfect foresight model. Any additions and clarifications welcome.

First a code block is provided and then the accompanying description is given. Summaries of the description are attempted for most of the code blocks, but this is not a rule. 

The idea is to have a narrative description of the code to ease interpretation. 

References to other parts of the Dynare codebase will be provided in future. 

## Notes on the code

We start with the `PerfectForesightSetupOptions` struct. 

```julia
"""
PerfectForesightSetupOptions type 
    periods::Int64 - number of periods in the simulation [required]
    datafile::String - optional data filename with guess values for the simulation and initial and terminal values
"""
struct PerfectForesightSetupOptions
    periods::Int64
    datafile::String
    function PerfectForesightSetupOptions(options::Dict{String,Any})
        periods = 0
        datafile = ""
        for (k, v) in pairs(options)
            if k == "periods"
                periods = v::Int64
            elseif k == "datafile"
                datafile = v::String
            end
        end
        if periods == 0
            throw(DomainError(periods, "periods must be set to a number greater than zero"))
        end
        new(periods, datafile)
    end
end
```

This is a struct for the `PerfectForesightSetupOptions` type.

It has two fields: `periods` and `datafile`. 

The `periods` field is required and is of type `Int64`, representing the number of periods in the simulation.

The `datafile` field is optional and is of type String, representing the name of a data file with guess values for the simulation and initial and terminal values. The values can be provided in several ways. See the section in the [[Dynare manual]].  

The struct also has a constructor function `PerfectForesightSetupOptions` which takes a dictionary as input and assigns values to the `periods` and `datafile` fields accordingly. The constructor also checks if the `periods` field is greater than zero and throws an error if not.

```julia
function perfect_foresight_setup!(context, field)
    options = PerfectForesightSetupOptions(get(field, "options", Dict{String,Any}()))
    context.work.perfect_foresight_setup["periods"] = options.periods
    context.work.perfect_foresight_setup["datafile"] = options.datafile
end
```

---

This assigns the `periods` and `datafile` values from the `options` variable to the corresponding fields in the `context.work.perfect_foresight_setup` dictionary. It doesn't return anything, it modifies the `context` in place.

----

This is a function in Julia called `perfect_foresight_setup!`, It takes two arguments, a `context` and a `field`. 

The function is used to set up the perfect foresight simulation by extracting the options from the `field` argument and then augmenting / mutating the `context` input. 

It first creates a variable called `options` by calling the `PerfectForesightSetupOptions` constructor function and passing it the result of calling `get(field, "options", Dict{String,Any}())`. 

This gets the `options` field from the `field` argument, which should be a dictionary, and if it doesn't exist, it defaults to an empty dictionary. 

Then it sets `context.work.perfect_foresight_setup["periods"]` to `options.periods` and `context.work.perfect_foresight_setup["datafile"]` to `options.datafile`. 

This function is setting up the perfect foresight setup for a given `context`. The `context` argument is where all the model information is contained. 

```julia
@enum PerfectForesightAlgo trustregionA
@enum LinearSolveAlgo ilu pardiso
@enum InitializationAlgo initvalfile steadystate firstorder linearinterpolation
```

There are three `@enum` macros here. They define enumerated types for different algorithms used in the perfect foresight simulation.

An enumerated type is a special kind of data type that has a finite set of values. I like the enumerated types since you can ensure that only valid options are used, and it makes the code more readable and less prone to errors.

The first `@enum` defines the `PerfectForesightAlgo` enumerated type with a single member `trustregionA`. This means that the only possible value for the type `PerfectForesightAlgo` is `trustregionA`. There are several solution algorithms in the MATLAB version of Dynare. Here we focus on the Newton method with [[trust region]]. 

The second `@enum` defines the `LinearSolveAlgo` enumerated type with two members `ilu` and `pardiso`. This means that the possible values for the type `LinearSolveAlgo` are `ilu` or `pardiso`. Here `ilu` refers to to the [[incomplete LU]] factorisation and `pardiso` is the [[parallel direct solver]] from the PARDISO solver project. 

The third `@enum` defines the `InitializationAlgo` enumerated type with four members: `initvalfile`, `steadystate`, `firstorder` and `linearinterpolation`. 

This means that the possible values for the type `InitializationAlgo` are `initvalfile`, `steadystate`, `firstorder` or `linearinterpolation`.

```julia
struct PerfectForesightSolverOptions
    algo::PerfectForesightAlgo
    display::Bool
    homotopy::Bool
    linear_solve_algo::LinearSolveAlgo
    maxit::Int64
    tolf::Float64
    tolx::Float64
    function PerfectForesightSolverOptions(context, field)
        algo = trustregionA
        display = true
        homotopy = false
        linear_solve_algo = ILU
        maxit = 50
        tolf = 1e-5
        tolx = 1e-5
        for (k, v) in pairs(options)
            if k == "stack_solve_algo"
                algo = v::Int64
            elseif k == "noprint"
                display = false
            elseif k == "print"
                display = true
            elseif k == "homotopy"
                homotopy = true
            elseif k == "no_homotopy"
                homotopy = false
            elseif k == "solve_algo"
                linear_solve_algo = v
            elseif k == "maxit"
                maxit = v
            elseif k == "tolf"
                tolf = v
            elseif k == "tolx"
                tolf = v
            end
        end
        new(algo, display, homotopy, linear_solve_algo, maxit, tolf, tolx)
    end
end
```

This is a struct for the `PerfectForesightSolverOptions` type.

It has seven fields: `algo`, `display`, `homotopy`, `linear_solve_algo`, `maxit`, `tolf`, and `tolx`.

The fields `algo`, `linear_solve_algo` are of type `PerfectForesightAlgo`, and `LinearSolveAlgo` respectively.

`display`, `homotopy` are of type `Bool` representing whether or not to display the output and whether or not to use homotopy.

`maxit` is of type `Int64` and represents the maximum number of iterations.

`tolf` and `tolx` are of type `Float64` and represent the tolerance level for the solution.

The struct also has a constructor function `PerfectForesightSolverOptions` which takes a `context` and a `field` as input. It assigns default values to the fields and then loops through the options in the field and assigns the values accordingly. If the `options` field does not exist in the `field` argument, it will use the default values. It then creates a new instance of `PerfectForesightSolverOptions` with the assigned values and returns it.

            else
                exogenous_steady_state = trends.exogenous_steady_state
            end
            x = repeat(exogenous_steady_state, periods)
        else
            x = Vector{Float64}(undef, 0, 0)

            shocks = Matrix{Float64}(undef, pmax, m.exogenous_nbr)
            shocks .= reshape(shocks_tmp, (pmax, m.exogenous_nbr))

        else
            shocks = Matrix{Float64}(undef, 0, 0)

        (J, permutationsJ) = makeJacobian(colptr,
                                          rowval,

---

The `PerfectForesightWs` struct is used to create a working space for the perfect foresight solver. It contains fields to store the endogenous variables, exogenous variables, shocks, and Jacobian matrix. It also contains fields to store the lower and upper bounds, permutations of residuals, and permutations of Jacobian matrix.

The constructor of the struct takes a `context` and a `periods` argument, which is used to initialize the fields. The `context` argument is used to access the model's information such as the number of endogenous variables, exogenous variables, and the Jacobian matrix. The `periods` argument is used to set the number of periods for the perfect foresight solver. It then returns an instance of the struct with all the fields initialized.

---

Let us dive into a bit more detail here. 

The struct has eight fields: `y`, `x`, `shocks`, `J`, `lb`, `ub`, `permutationsR`, `permutationsJ`.

-   `y` is a vector of type `Vector{Float64}` representing endogenous variables.
-   `x` is a vector of type `Vector{Float64}` representing exogenous variables.
-   `shocks` is a matrix of type `Matrix{Float64}` representing shocks.
-   `J` is a sparse matrix of type `SparseMatrixCSC` representing the Jacobian matrix.
-   `lb` and `ub` are vectors of type `Vector{Float64}` representing lower and upper bounds of variables.
-   `permutationsR` is a vector of type `Vector{Tuple{Int64,Int64}}` representing permutations of the rows of the Jacobian matrix.
-   `permutationsJ` is a vector of type `Vector{Tuple{Int64,Int64}}` representing permutations of the columns of the Jacobian matrix.

The struct also has a constructor function `PerfectForesightWs` which takes a `context` and a `periods` as input. 

It first declares a few variables like `m` and `modfileinfo` and assigns them the values from the `context`. 

Let us take some time to describe what these variables contain, 

`context.models[1]` – Container for info on current model
`context.modefileinfo` – Some essential information, such as whether an `endvalue` has been specified, whether there are trends, etc. 
`context.results.model_results[1].trends` – Contains several vectors with steady state and trend information. 

It then creates the `y` vector by using the `m.endogenous_nbr` and initializing it with `undef`. 

It then checks if there are any exogenous variables and if yes, it creates the `x` vector and assigns it the exogenous steady state values.

It then checks if there are any shocks, if yes, it creates the `shocks` matrix and assigns it the values from the `context.work.shocks`. 

It then creates the `permutationsR` vector by iterating over `m.mcps`. It then calls a function `makeJacobian` and assigns the resulting Jacobian matrix and permutationsJ to the `J` and `permutationsJ` fields respectively. It then initializes the `lb` and `ub` fields with empty vectors of type `Float64`. It then creates a new instance of `PerfectForesightWs` with the assigned values and returns it.

```julia
function perfect_foresight_solver!(context, field)
    periods = context.work.perfect_foresight_setup["periods"]
    datafile = context.work.perfect_foresight_setup["datafile"]
    m = context.models[1]
    ncol = m.n_bkwrd + m.n_current + m.n_fwrd + 2 * m.n_both
    tmp_nbr =  m.dynamic_tmp_nbr::Vector{Int64}
    dynamic_ws = DynamicWs(m.endogenous_nbr,
                           m.exogenous_nbr,
                           sum(tmp_nbr[1:2]),
                           m.dynamic_g1_sparse_colptr,
                           m.dynamic_g1_sparse_rowval)

    perfect_foresight_ws = PerfectForesightWs(context, periods)
    X = perfect_foresight_ws.shocks
    initial_values = get_dynamic_initialvalues(context)
    terminal_values = get_dynamic_terminalvalues(context, periods)
    guess_values = perfect_foresight_initialization!(
        context,
        periods,
        datafile,
        X,
        perfect_foresight_ws,
        steadystate,
        dynamic_ws,
    )
    if haskey(field, "options") && get(field["options"], "lmmcp.status", false)
        mcp_perfectforesight_core!(
            perfect_foresight_ws,
            context,
            periods,
            guess_values,
            initial_values,
            terminal_values,
            dynamic_ws,
        )
    else
        perfectforesight_core!(
            perfect_foresight_ws,
            context,
            periods,
            guess_values,
            initial_values,
            terminal_values,
            dynamic_ws,
        )
    end
end
```

---

This function sets up the perfect foresight model, initializes the guess values, and calls the appropriate solver to solve the model. It also allows for the choice of using a specific algorithm for solving the model, based on the presence of `lmmcp.status` flag in the options field.

---

This is a function called `perfect_foresight_solver!`. It takes two arguments, a `context` and a `field`. The function is used to solve the perfect foresight model by extracting the options and working set data from the `context` argument and passing them to the appropriate solver function.

It first extracts the `periods` and `datafile` from the `context.work.perfect_foresight_setup` and assigns them to the corresponding variables. 

Then it creates a `DynamicWs` struct and assigns it the values from the `context` and also creates a `PerfectForesightWs` struct.

It then creates a variable `X` and assigns it the `shocks` field of `perfect_foresight_ws`. It then calls two functions `get_dynamic_initialvalues` and `get_dynamic_terminalvalues` and assigns the returned values to `initial_values` and `terminal_values` respectively.

It then calls a function `perfect_foresight_initialization!` which takes the `context`, `periods`, `datafile`, `X`, `perfect_foresight_ws`, `steadystate`, and `dynamic_ws` and initializes the guess values.

Then it checks if the "options" field of the `field` argument contains a key "lmmcp.status" and its value is true. If it is true, it calls a function `mcp_perfectforesight_core!` which takes the `perfect_foresight_ws`, `context`, `periods`, `guess_values`, `initial_values`, `terminal_values`, and `dynamic_ws` as inputs and solves the model. 

Otherwise, it calls a function `perfectforesight_core!` which takes the same inputs and solves the model.

```julia
function get_dynamic_initialvalues(context::Context)
    endo_nbr = context.models[1].endogenous_nbr 
    work = context.work
    modfileinfo = context.modfileinfo
    y0 = zeros(context.models[1].endogenous_nbr)
    if modfileinfo.has_histval
        @views for i in eachindex(skipmissing(work.histval[lastindex(work.histval, 1), 1:endo_nbr]))
            y0[i] = work.histval[end, i]
        end
        return y0
    elseif modfileinfo.has_initval_file
        @views for i in eachindex(skipmissing(work.initval[lastindex(work.initval, 1), 1:endo_nbr]))
            y0[i] = work.initval[end, i]
        end
        return y0
    else
        trends = context.results.model_results[1].trends
        if isempty(trends.endogenous_steady_state)
            compute_steady_state!(context, Dict{String,Any}())
        end
        return trends.endogenous_steady_state
    end
end
```

This function is called `get_dynamic_initialvalues`. It takes a single argument `context` (of type `Context`) – see the Dynare containers scripts for better idea of the construction of this Context type – and returns a vector of initial values for the endogenous variables.

It first extracts the number of endogenous variables from the `context.models[1].endogenous_nbr` and assigns it to the variable `endo_nbr`. It also extracts the `work` and `modfileinfo` fields from the `context`. It then initializes a vector `y0` with the same length as `endo_nbr` and sets all elements to zero.

It then checks if the `modfileinfo` has `has_histval` field set to true. If it is true, it loops over each index of `work.histval` and assigns the corresponding value to the `y0` vector. Then it returns `y0`.

Otherwise, it checks if the `modfileinfo` has `has_initval_file` field set to true. If it is true, it loops over each index of `work.initval` and assigns the corresponding value to the `y0` vector. Then it returns `y0`.

Otherwise, it extracts the `trends` field from `context.results.model_results[1].trends` and checks if `trends.endogenous_steady_state` is empty. If it is empty, it calls the function `compute_steady_state!` and passes the `context` and an empty dictionary as arguments. Then it returns `trends.endogenous_steady_state`.

This function is used to extract the initial values for the endogenous variables of the model. It checks if the initial values are provided in the data file or if the steady state values need to be calculated, and returns the appropriate initial values.

```julia
function get_dynamic_terminalvalues(context::Context, periods)
    work = context.work
    modfileinfo = context.modfileinfo
    yT = zeros(context.models[1].endogenous_nbr)
    if modfileinfo.has_initval_file
        @views for i in eachindex(skipmissing(view(work.initval, size(work.initval, 1), :)))
            yT[i] = work.initval[end, i]
        end
        return yT
    else
        trends = context.results.model_results[1].trends
        if isempty(trends.endogenous_steady_state)
            compute_steady_state!(context, Dict{String,Any}())
        end
        if modfileinfo.has_endval
            return trends.endogenous_terminal_steady_state
        else
            return trends.endogenous_steady_state
        end
    end
end
```

This function is called `get_dynamic_terminalvalues`. It takes two arguments, `context` of type `Context` and `periods`, and returns a vector of terminal values for the endogenous variables.

It first extracts the `work` and `modfileinfo` fields from the `context`. It then initializes a vector `yT` with the same length as the number of endogenous variables of the model and sets all elements to zero.

It then checks if the `modfileinfo` has `has_initval_file` field set to true. If it is true, it loops over each index of `work.initval` and assigns the corresponding value to the `yT` vector. Then it returns `yT`.

Otherwise, it extracts the `trends` field from `context.results.model_results[1].trends` and checks if `trends.endogenous_steady_state` is empty. If it is empty, it calls the function `compute_steady_state!` and passes the `context` and an empty dictionary as arguments. Then it checks if `modfileinfo` has `has_endval` field set to true. If it is true, it returns `trends.endogenous_terminal_steady_state`. Otherwise, it returns `trends.endogenous. 

```julia
function perfect_foresight_initialization!(
    context,
    periods,
    datafile,
    exogenous,
    perfect_foresight_ws,
    algo::InitializationAlgo,
    dynamic_ws::DynamicWs,
)
    modfileinfo = context.modfileinfo
    trends = context.results.model_results[1].trends
    if algo == initvalfile
        initval = work.initval
        guess_values = view(initval, :, 2:periods - 1)
    elseif algo == linearinterpolation
    elseif algo == steadystate 
        if isempty(trends.endogenous_steady_state)
            compute_steady_state!(context, Dict{String,Any}())
        end
        if modfileinfo.has_endval
            x = trends.endogenous_terminal_steady_state
        else
            x = trends.endogenous_steady_state
        end
        guess_values = repeat(x, periods)
    elseif algo == firstorder
        guess_values = simul_first_order!(context, periods, exogenous, dynamic_ws)
    end
    return guess_values
end
```

This function is called `perfect_foresight_initialization!`. It takes seven arguments:

-   `context` of type `Context`
-   `periods` of type `Int64`
-   `datafile` of type `String`
-   `exogenous` of type `Matrix{Float64}`
-   `perfect_foresight_ws` of type `PerfectForesightWs`
-   `algo` of type `InitializationAlgo`
-   `dynamic_ws` of type `DynamicWs`

The function initializes the guesses for the endogenous variables for the perfect foresight solution. 

It first extracts the `modfileinfo` and `trends` fields from the `context`. Then it checks the value of the `algo` variable and based on that it assigns the values of endogenous variables for the perfect foresight solution. 

If `algo` is `initvalfile`, it assigns `work.initval` to `guess_values` and returns it. If `algo` is `linearinterpolation`, it does not do anything as far as I can see.

If `algo` is `steadystate`, it checks if `trends.endogenous_steady_state` is empty and if it is, it calls the function `compute_steady_state!` and passes the `context` and an empty dictionary as arguments. Then it checks if `modfileinfo` has `has_endval` field set to true. If it is true, it assigns `trends.endogenous_terminal_steady_state` to `guess_values`, otherwise it assigns `trends.endogenous_steady_state` to `guess_values` and then repeat it for `periods` times.

If `algo` is `firstorder`, it calls the function `simul_first_order!` and passes `context`, `periods`, `exogenous` and `dynamic_ws` as arguments, and assigns the returned value to `guess_values`. Finally, it returns `guess_values`

```julia
function simul_first_order!(
    context::Context,
    periods::Int64,
    X::AbstractVector{Float64},
    dynamic_ws::DynamicWs,

This function is defining a function `simul_first_order!` which simulates the first-order solution of a model.

The function takes in as input a `Context` object which contains information about the model, simulation options, and other relevant data, a number of periods over which to simulate the model, and a vector `X` of exogenous variable values.

It also takes in a `DynamicWs` object which contains information related to the dynamic model such as the steady state values, the matrices A and B, and the temporary storage vector `temp_vec`.

The function starts by initializing some options and objects such as the `StochSimulOptions` and the `DynamicWs`. Then it calculates the steady state, linear trend, and initial values of the endogenous variables. Then it uses the `compute_stoch_simul!` function to simulate the model over the specified number of periods and stores the results in the `simulresults` matrix. The function then returns a tuple of views of the results for the first period, the middle periods, and the final period.

This is the function `perfectforesight_core!`. It is used to solve a perfect foresight model using a non-linear solver algorithm. It takes in 7 arguments:

1.  `perfect_foresight_ws`: a type of `PerfectForesightWs` which contains the results of the perfect foresight solver.
2.  `context`: a type of `Context` which contains all the information needed for the model simulation.
3.  `periods`: an `Int64` specifying the number of periods for which the simulation is done.
4.  `y0`: an `AbstractVector` of `Float64` representing the initial values of the endogenous variables.
5.  `initialvalues`: a `Vector` of type `Real` representing the initial values of the endogenous variables
6.  `terminalvalues`: a `Vector` of type `Real` representing the terminal values of the endogenous variables
7.  `dynamic_ws`: a type of `DynamicWs` which contains the information needed for the dynamic simulation.

The function takes in several inputs, including a `PerfectForesightWs` struct which contains various data structures and variables that are used in the solution process, such as the Jacobian matrix, permutations for reordering the residuals, and the exogenous variables. It also takes in a `Context` object which contains information about the model and the current state of the computation, a `periods` integer indicating the number of periods in the simulation, an initial `y0` vector of endogenous variables, `initialvalues` and `terminalvalues` vectors, a `dynamic_ws` struct which contains data structures used in the dynamic computation of the model, and `params` vector of parameter values.

The function starts by defining some local variables, such as the number of endogenous variables, the steady state values, and the parameters. It also creates a `temp_vec` variable and several `ws_threaded` structs.

Then, it defines two functions `f!` and `J!` which are used to augment the residuals and Jacobian matrix, respectively. These functions utilize other functions such as `make_pf_residuals` and `make_pf_jacobian` to perform their calculations.

Finally, it creates a `df` object of type `OnceDifferentiable` which takes in the `f!` and `J!` functions and the initial values for the residuals and Jacobian matrix. It then calls the `nlsolve` function to solve the non-linear model, passing in the `df` object, the initial values, and a method of `:robust_

Finally, it calls the non-linear solver `nlsolve` to solve the system of equations. The final values obtained from the solver are then stored in the context's `model_results` field in a `Simulation` object.

```

The function `make_pf_residuals` takes in several inputs, including the initial values, terminal values, exogenous variables, dynamic variables, steady state, parameters, and the model object. It also takes in the number of periods, a temporary vector, and a vector of permutations.

-   `initialvalues`: a vector of initial values for the endogenous variables
-   `terminalvalues`: a vector of terminal values for the endogenous variables
-   `exogenous`: a vector of exogenous variables
-   `dynamic_variables`: a vector of dynamic variables
-   `steadystate`: a vector of steady state values for the endogenous variables
-   `params`: a vector of parameter values
-   `m`: the Model struct
-   `periods`: the number of periods in the simulation
-   `temp_vec`: a vector of temporary values
-   `permutations`: a vector of permutations, which is used to reorder the residuals

It defines and returns an anonymous function `f!`, which takes in a residual vector and a vector of state variables. The function `f!` calls the `get_residuals!` function which computes the residuals based on the input values and the state variables, assigns the residuals to the input residuals vector and returns it.

The function takes in two inputs: `residuals` and `y`. `residuals` is the vector where the residuals are stored, and `y` is a vector of endogenous variable values. The function uses the `get_residuals!` function to calculate the residuals and store them in the `residuals` vector, using the inputs passed to the closure as well as the values in `y`. The function returns the residuals vector. It is worth noting that this function is returning a closure which is to be used by the `nlsolve` algorithm to calculate the residuals.

The function `make_pf_jacobian` is a function factory that creates and returns another function `J!`. The returned function `J!` takes two arguments as input: a sparse matrix `A` and a vector `y`. 

It updates the sparse matrix `A` by calling the `updateJacobian!` function with input arguments `A`, `dynamic_derivatives!`, `y`, `initialvalues`, `terminalvalues`, `dynamic_variables`, `exogenous`, `periods`, `temp_vec`, `params`, `steadystate`, `dynamic_g1_sparse_colptr`, `nzval`, `endogenous_nbr`, `exogenous_nbr`, `permutations`, and `nzval1`. The returned function `J!` returns the updated sparse matrix `A`.

More specifically it looks like the `make_pf_jacobian` function creates a closure that takes in a sparse matrix `A` and a vector `y`, and returns the sparse matrix `A` after updating it with the Jacobian of the residuals. 

The function uses the `updateJacobian!` function. The `updateJacobian!` function takes in the following inputs:

-   `dynamic_derivatives!`: a function that computes the derivatives of the residuals with respect to the endogenous variables
-   `y`: a vector of the endogenous variables
-   `initialvalues`: a vector of the initial values of the endogenous variables
-   `terminalvalues`: a vector of the terminal values of the endogenous variables
-   `dynamic_variables`: a vector of the dynamic variables, which are the endogenous variables over the entire simulation period
-   `exogenous`: a vector of the exogenous variables
-   `periods`: the number of periods in the simulation
-   `temp_vec`: a vector of temporary values
-   `params`: a vector of parameters
-   `steadystate`: a vector of the steady state values of the endogenous variables
-   `dynamic_g1_sparse_colptr`: a vector of the column pointers of the Jacobian
-   `nzval`: a vector of the non-zero values of the Jacobian
-   `endogenous_nbr`: the number of endogenous variables
-   `exogenous_nbr`: the number of exogenous variables
-   `permutations`: a vector of permutations of the residuals
-   `nzval1`: a vector of non-zero values of the updated Jacobian

The function also makes use of the permutations to reorder the residuals and the Jacobian before and after updating it, respectively.

This function is used to calculate the residuals of the perfect foresight model. The residuals are calculated based on the initial and terminal values of the endogenous variables, the exogenous variables and the steady state values. 

The function takes as input:

-   `residuals`: a vector in which the residuals will be stored.
-   `endogenous`: a vector containing the predicted values of the endogenous variables.
-   `initialvalues`: a vector containing the initial values of the endogenous variables.
-   `terminalvalues`: a vector containing the terminal values of the endogenous variables.
-   `exogenous`: a vector containing the values of the exogenous variables.
-   `dynamic_variables`: a vector containing the dynamic variables.
-   `steadystate`: a vector containing the steady state values of the endogenous variables.
-   `params`: a vector containing the model's parameters.
-   `m`: an instance of the Model struct, which stores information about the model.
-   `periods`: an integer representing the number of periods in the simulation.
-   `temp_vec`: a vector used as a temporary storage for intermediate calculations.
-   `permutations`: a vector of tuples containing the permutations of the model's equations.

The function calculates the residuals for each period by calling three different sub-functions: `get_residuals_1!`, `get_residuals_2!`, and `get_residuals_3!` which are responsible for calculating the residuals for the initial period, intermediate periods, and the final period respectively. 

The function utilizes views, which I am assuming is for performance optimization.

```julia
@inline function reorder!(x, permutations)
    for p in permutations
        p1 = p[1]
        p2 = p[2]
        x[p2], x[p1] = x[p1], x[p2]
    end
end
```

This function, `reorder!(x, permutations)`, takes in two arguments:

-   `x`, which is an array of values that will be reordered,
-   `permutations`, which is a vector of tuples that specifies the indices of elements to swap.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through each tuple in `permutations` and swap the values of elements at the indices specified by the tuple. 

The `@inline` macro is used to suggest that the compiler should insert the function body directly at the call site – this can lead to a performance improvement for small functions that are called frequently in tight loops.

```julia
@inline function reorder!(x, permutations, offset)
    for p in permutations
        p1 = p[1] + offset
        p2 = p[2] + offset
        x[p2], x[p1] = x[p1], x[p2]
    end
end
```

This is an inline function, which means that when it is called, the Julia compiler will replace the function call with the code written inside the function. The function takes three inputs:

-   `x` which is an array of any type
-   `permutations` which is a vector of tuples, each tuple containing two integers
-   `offset` which is an integer

The function performs in-place reordering of the elements of `x` array according to the permutations passed as the second argument. The permutations are defined as (`p1`,`p2`) where `p1` and `p2` are indices of the array. The function will swap the elements at position `p1` with the elements at position `p2`.

The `offset` variable is added to each of the indices in the permutation tuples before swapping the elements. The function does not return any output, it modifies the input array in place.

```julia
@inline function reorder1!(x, permutations, n)
    isempty(permutations) && return
    reorder!(x, permutations, 0)
    reorder!(x, permutations, n)
end
```

The function `reorder1!` takes in three arguments:

-   `x`: a vector that you want to reorder
-   `permutations`: a vector of tuples that specify the indices of the elements that need to be swapped
-   `n`: an integer, which is used as an offset when reordering the elements in `x`.

The function first checks if the `permutations` argument is empty and if so, it exits the function. 

If `permutations` is not empty, the function calls the `reorder!` function twice. The first call reorders the first `n` elements of `x` according to the permutations, and the second call reorders the next `n` elements of `x` according to the permutations, but with an offset of `n`. 

This function reorder the elements of a vector according to the provided permutations, and it takes the first `n` elements and the next `n` elements of the vector and reorder them using the permutations, with an offset `n` for the latter set of elements.

```julia
@inline function reorder2!(x, permutations, t, n)
    isempty(permutations) && return
    reorder!(x, permutations, (t - 2) * n)
    reorder!(x, permutations, (t - 1) * n)
    reorder!(x, permutations, t * n)
end
```

This is a function that reorders the elements of a vector `x` based on a provided set of permutations, `permutations`. The function applies the permutations twice, once to the first `n` elements, and then again to the next `n` elements. The argument `t` is used to specify the offset at which the permutations will be applied.

For example, if `x` is a vector of length 6, `n` is 2, and `t` is 2, and the permutations are `(2,1)` and `(1,2)`, the function will apply the permutations to elements 2 and 3 of `x`, and then again to elements 4 and 5 of `x`. The resulting vector will have the elements at positions 2 and 3 swapped with the elements at positions 1 and 2, and the elements at positions 4 and 5 swapped with the elements at positions 3 and 4 respectively.

```julia
@inline function reorder3!(x, permutations, t, n)
    isempty(permutations) && return
    reorder!(x, permutations, (t - 2) * n)
    reorder!(x, permutations, (t - 1) * n)
end
```

This function is similar to the previous `reorder2!` function, but it only reorders the elements of the input `x` array at the positions corresponding to the two periods before the terminal period `t`.

Like the previous function, it takes as input `x`, which is the array to be reordered, `permutations`, which is a vector of tuple pairs indicating the indices of elements to be swapped, `t`, which is the terminal period, and `n`, which is the number of elements in each period. If the input `permutations` is empty, it will not do anything.

The function `get_residuals_1!` is a function that calculates the residuals for the first period of a perfect foresight simulation. The function takes in several inputs such as the residuals vector, the endogenous variables vector, the initial values vector, the exogenous variables vector, the dynamic variables vector, the steady state vector, the parameters vector, and a temporary vector. 

These inputs are used to calculate the residuals for the first period of the simulation using the `dynamic!` function provided by `DFunctions`. The function also reorders the residuals vector using the `reorder!` function and a permutations vector.

The function starts by copying the initial values to the dynamic variables and the endogenous variables to the next section of the dynamic variables. Then it calls the dynamic function of the model to calculate the residuals for the first period and store them in the residuals vector. Finally, it reorders the residuals according to the permutation vector, if provided.

The function `get_residuals_2!` takes in several inputs:

-   `residuals`: a vector of residuals that is being calculated
-   `endogenous`: a vector of endogenous variables
-   `exogenous`: a vector of exogenous variables
-   `steadystate`: a vector of steady state variables
-   `params`: a vector of model parameters
-   `temp_vec`: a vector of temporary values used for calculations
-   `t`: the current period
-   `permutations`: a vector of tuple pairs representing variables permutations

It then proceeds to:

-   Define a variable `n` equal to the length of the `steadystate` vector
-   Create a view of a subset of the `residuals` vector, which corresponds to the current period
-   Call the function `DFunctions.dynamic!`, which calculates the residuals for the current period, passing in the temporary vector, the view of the residuals vector, the current endogenous variables, exogenous variables, and steady state variables and parameters
-   Apply the permutation of variables specified in the `permutations` vector
-   The function returns the updated residuals

The `get_residuals_3!` function is used to calculate the residuals of the third and last period of the perfect foresight model. The function takes in several arguments:

-   `residuals`: A vector of residuals, which is the difference between the expected and actual values of the endogenous variables.
-   `endogenous`: A vector of endogenous variables, which are the variables that are determined within the model.
-   `terminalvalues`: A vector of terminal values, representing the expected values of the endogenous variables at the end of the simulation period.
-   `exogenous`: A vector of exogenous variables, which are the variables that are determined outside of the model.
-   `dynamic_variables`: A vector of dynamic variables, which are used to calculate the residuals of the model.
-   `steadystate`: A vector of steady state values, representing the long-run equilibrium values of the endogenous variables.
-   `params`: A vector of model parameters.
-   `temp_vec`: A vector of temporary values, used in the calculation of residuals.
-   `periods`: The total number of periods in the simulation.
-   `permutations`: A vector of permutations, indicating the reordering of residuals and Jacobian matrix (if provided).

The function starts by copying the values of the endogenous variables and the terminal values to the dynamic variables vector. Then it calls the `dynamic!` function from the `DFunctions` module, passing in the necessary arguments such as `temp_vec`, `dynamic_variables`, `exogenous`, `params`, and `steadystate`. The function then reorders the residuals vector using the `reorder!` function and the permutations provided. The reordered residuals vector is then returned as the output.

These are functions that are used to calculate the residuals of a perfect foresight model.

`get_residuals_1!` takes in the residuals vector, an endogenous vector, initial values, exogenous variables, dynamic variables, steady state, parameters, and a temporary vector. It then copies the initial values to the dynamic variables vector, copies the endogenous values to the dynamic variables vector, and calculates the residuals for the first period using the `DFunctions.dynamic!` function and the values passed in. Finally it reorders the residuals vector based on the permutations passed in.

`get_residuals_2!` takes in the residuals vector, an endogenous vector, exogenous variables, steady state, parameters, a temporary vector, and a current period (t). It then calculates the residuals for period t using the `DFunctions.dynamic!` function and the values passed in and reorders the residuals vector based on the permutations passed in.

`get_residuals_3!` takes in the residuals vector, an endogenous vector, terminal values, exogenous variables, dynamic variables, steady state, parameters, a temporary vector, and the total number of periods. It then copies the endogenous values to the dynamic variables vector, copies the terminal values to the dynamic variables vector and calculates the residuals for the last period using the `DFunctions.dynamic!` function and the values passed in. Finally it reorders the residuals vector based on the permutations passed in.

These functions are used together by the `get_residuals!` function which uses them to calculate the residuals for all periods in the perfect foresight model.

```

It seems that `print_nlsolver_results(r)` is a function that takes an input `r` which is the result of the non-linear solver algorithm, and prints information about the result of the algorithm to the console. The function prints the algorithm name, the `inf-norm` of the residuals, the number of iterations, whether the algorithm converged, the values for the convergence tolerance for `x` and `f`, the number of function calls made during the algorithm. It is a helper function that provides an easy way to check the results of the non-linear solver algorithm.
