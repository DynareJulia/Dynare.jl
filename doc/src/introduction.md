# Introduction 

DynareJulia is a rewriting of Dynare (https://www.dynare.org) that was initially written in
Gauss in 1994 and rewritten in Matlab around 2000.

Dynare provides several algorithms to work with Dynamic Stochastic
General Equilibrium (DSGE) models often used in macroeconomics. Among
other features, it helps
 - solving such models,
 - simulating them,
 - estimating the parameters,
 - making forecasts.
 
The user of the package writes a text file, usually with an ".mod"
extension, that contains the equations of the model and the
computation tasks. Then, DynareJulia compiles the model and runs the computations.
